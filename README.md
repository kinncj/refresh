refresh
=======
Your webdevelopment tool

About
======
A tool(proxy) that refreshes your browser based on filesystem notifications.

With refresh, you can have live updates from your web server based on your filesystem updates.

Motivation and decision
======

* Motivation
	* I really love some Mac editors that give me live preview when I'm coding some PHP stuff.

	* But I'm not always on Mac, so I decide to create this to help my work at Linux too... this way I can get the "live preview" resource with any editor/IDE.

	* Learn new things.

* Decision
	* At first time I knew that I would need some "socket" interaction to tell my browser: "Refresh please...".
	* So, when I think about socket, "daemons", "remote interactions" and "web browsers" I think node.
	* This way I started a new saga to learn and finish this "app" in the past 1 day.


Usage
======

	npm install refresh

	refresh -s 127.0.0.1 -p 1337 -r http://localhost -t 80 -d /var/www
	refresh -h
	refresh --server 127.0.0.1 --localport 1337 --remoteserver http://localhost --remoteport 80 --directory /var/www

Roadmap
======
- Automated tests

- Command executer for every filesystem notification

	example:

	refresh -s 127.0.0.1 -p 1337 -r http://localhost -t 80 -d /var/www -c "phpunit tests/unit/"

	this way developers can trigger commands for every filesystem update
